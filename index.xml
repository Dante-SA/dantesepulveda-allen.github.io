      <description>R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:
summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.</description>

      <description>Introduction For this project, I chose two datasets, the first being “college_recent_grads” which has data about recent college grads who just earned their Bachelors degrees such as, major, major category, median income, unemployment rate, the amount of men and women polled from each major, the total amount of people polled from each major, whether they are employed full or part-time, and what type of job they have. The second is “college_grad_students” which has data about recent graduate school graduates such as, major, major category, median income, unemployment rate, number of people polled for each major, whether they were employed, and if they were employed full-time or not.</description>

      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (preferably HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by :59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
