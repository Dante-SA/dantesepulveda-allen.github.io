      <description>Someone call the vet, cause these pythons are SICK I used to think that coding languages like Python were completely separate from the statistical stuff I did on R and RStudio. Then I took Computational Biology (SDS348) here at the University of Texas at Austin and I learned so much about R, RMarkdown, and even dabbled into Python (shout out to Dr. Woodward). Here I am going to show y’all how to use reticulate between R and Python.</description>
