## Someone call the vet, cause these pythons are SICK

I used to think that coding languages like Python were completely separate from the statistical stuff I did on R and RStudio. Then I took Computational Biology (SDS348) here at the University of Texas at Austin and I learned so much about R, RMarkdown, and even dabbled into Python (shout out to Dr. Woodward). Here I am going to show y'all how to use reticulate between R and Python. It essentially allows you to cross the bridge between the two languages resulting in cohesive code.
```{r}
#For example this is an R chunk
library(reticulate)
piece1 <- "Let's get this"
```

```{python}
#And this is a python chunk
piece2="party started"
print(r.piece1,piece2)
```

Badabing, Badaboom. This is just some basics with reticulate, but I just wanted to flex on my past self that I knew how to acutally do this. There is a whole world of crazy things one can do through R and Python. With both now at my disposal, Thanos is trembling.
